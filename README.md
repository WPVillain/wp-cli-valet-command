this install over https.

## Installing

### Prerequisites

This command leverages [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/valet#installation) -- the development environment for Mac minimalists.
Because of this **support is unfortunately limited to Mac only**.

Follow the [installation instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/valet#installation) on the Laravel documentation to get started.
This is what makes it possible to load a site in your browser immediately after creating it, without any other configuration.

You will also need some understanding of how Valet works, especially the portion on [Serving Sites](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/valet#serving-sites).

Installing this package requires WP-CLI v0.23.0 or greater. Update to the latest stable release with `wp cli update`.

Once you've done so, you can install this package with `wp package install aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-valet-command`.
